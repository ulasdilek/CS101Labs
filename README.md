# CS 101 LABS
**ALL LABS ARE FINISHED AS OF DECEMBER 21ST 2021**

This repository functions both as a backup and a coding portfolio for me. Please feel free to explore. I ~will add~ *have added* each lab assignment too for people with studying purposes. Yet, not all files here are the same as those I have submitted because of changes in the lab revision.

I do not wish to encourage other CS 101 students to cheat in labs, so please abide by the lab honor code:
> You are allowed to reuse the codes given in your textbook and/or your lecture slides. However, you are not allowed to use any code from somewhere else (e.g., from the Internet, other textbooks or other slides).

Javadoc is available for packages listed [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ulasdilek/labs/blob/main/out/javadoc/allpackages-index.html). Please consider that I did not write a Javadoc for each lab since it takes a long time an unnecessary effort. ~But I just might create new ones for the sake of experience.~ *(I decided not to do that. It's too much work!)*

***Have a nice day!!!***
